correct and make this abstract shorter for me:

This study applies a simplified version of Maher's 1982 Poisson distribution model to recent English Premier League data to analyze football scores. Using the engsoccerdata dataset, we calculated team-specific attacking and defensive strengths and employed these in Poisson regression models to predict the number of goals scored by home and away teams. Our results validate Maher's approach, showing a significant correlation between team strengths and goal-scoring. However, the positive association between defensive strength and goals scored indicates complexities not fully addressed by the model. This analysis highlights the utility of statistical methods in sports analytics and suggests avenues for further research, including the development of more sophisticated models to better capture the dynamics of football scoring.

Results show a significant correlation between team strengths and scoring, but also indicate complexities in defensive strength's impact not fully captured by the model. This underscores the value of statistical methods in sports analytics and suggests further research into more advanced models to better understand football scoring dynamics.
